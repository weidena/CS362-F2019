In order to meet the criteria that would cause the program to crash 
(reaching state 9 with input char and spelling reset with input string)
I found ranges that would fall within the criteria.  This is to say that
I included everything from ' ' to ']' in my range for inputChar() to reach 
state 9 and all the letters that would spell reset in inputString().
To limit the range for inputString (so that the test would not take forever)
I only included letters e to t.
